                    Hi, Iâ€™m Chris Chun aka Michael Angelo. I am a web developer 
                    living and working in Tacoma, WA. I make websites beautiful, 
                    intuitive, and relevant.<br></br><br></br>
                    
                    As a naturally artistic and creative individual 
                    I have a wide gamut of design aesthetics ranging 
                    from cyber punk to minimalist. As a recreational mathematician,
                    I can leverage logic against abstract problems to achieve 
                    material design success.<br></br><br></br>

                    An avid skater since 1999, skateboarding has greatly shaped 
                    the lens by which I see the world and helped to define how I 
                    interact with it. While others driving down the street see people
                    and houses, I see a concrete jungle gym. I like to believe 
                    that its this type of creative outlook that keeps me inspired
                    and brings  me to continually challenge myself. 
                </p>
